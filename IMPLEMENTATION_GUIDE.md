# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: implement comprehensive code review system

- Add Codacy integration with automated analysis
- Configure GitHub Actions workflows for PR checks
- Add PR template with comprehensive checklist
- Create code review guidelines and documentation
- Setup ESLint configuration
- Add contributing guidelines
- Create branch protection setup guide"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main

**Example:**
```markdown
<!-- Before -->
[![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/YOUR_PROJECT_ID)]

<!-- After -->
[![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/abc123def456)]
```

Commit and push this change.

## ‚úÖ Verification

### Test 1: Verify Codacy Integration

1. **Go to** GitHub Actions tab
2. **Check** that workflows ran successfully
3. **Go to** Codacy dashboard
4. **Verify** that code analysis completed

**Expected Result:** ‚úÖ Codacy shows code quality grade

### Test 2: Test Branch Protection

```bash
# Try to push directly to main (should fail)
git checkout main
echo "test" >> test.txt
git add test.txt
git commit -m "test direct push"
git push origin main
```

**Expected Result:** ‚ùå Remote rejected (protected branch)

### Test 3: Create Test Pull Request

1. **Create feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b test/verify-pr-process
   echo "# Test PR" >> TEST.md
   git add TEST.md
   git commit -m "test: verify PR process"
   git push origin test/verify-pr-process
   ```

2. **Go to GitHub** and create PR
3. **Verify:**
   - ‚úÖ PR template is auto-filled
   - ‚úÖ Automated checks start running
   - ‚úÖ Codacy posts analysis comments
   - ‚úÖ Security scan runs
   - ‚úÖ Build check runs
   - ‚úÖ Merge is blocked until checks pass

**Expected Result:** ‚úÖ All automated checks run, merge requires approval

### Test 4: Test Review and Merge

1. **Have a senior developer approve** the test PR
2. **Verify** all checks are green
3. **Try to merge** (should only show "Squash and merge")
4. **Merge the PR**
5. **Verify** branch is auto-deleted

**Expected Result:** ‚úÖ PR merges with squash, branch auto-deleted

### Test 5: Cleanup Test PR

```bash
# Delete the test file
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git rm TEST.md
git commit -m "chore: remove test file"
git push origin main  # This will fail due to branch protection

# Create PR to remove it
git checkout -b chore/cleanup-test
git push origin chore/cleanup-test
# Create PR and merge it properly
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Workflows Not Running

**Problem:** GitHub Actions not triggering

**Solutions:**
1. Check that Actions are enabled in repo settings
2. Verify workflow files are in `.github/workflows/`
3. Check workflow syntax with YAML validator
4. Ensure secrets are properly set

### Codacy Not Posting Comments

**Problem:** Codacy analysis not showing in PRs

**Solutions:**
1. Verify `CODACY_PROJECT_TOKEN` is set in GitHub secrets
2. Check Codacy GitHub integration is enabled
3. Ensure "Issue annotations" is enabled in Codacy
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for analysis to complete

### Cannot Merge PR

**Problem:** Merge button is disabled

**Solutions:**
1. Check all required status checks passed
2. Ensure you have required approval (1 minimum)
3. Resolve all conversations
4. Update branch with latest changes from base
5. Fix any merge conflicts

### Direct Push Was Allowed

**Problem:** Someone pushed directly to main

**Solutions:**
1. Verify branch protection rules are saved
2. Check "Do not allow bypassing" is enabled
3. Ensure user doesn't have admin bypass
4. Review branch protection logs
