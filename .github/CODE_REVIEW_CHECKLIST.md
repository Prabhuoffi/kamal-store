# Code Review Checklist

Use this checklist when reviewing pull requests to ensure comprehensive and consistent code reviews.

## Quick Reference

**Review Priority:**
1. ‚ùó **Critical**: Security, data loss, breaking changes
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Logic errors, performance issues
3. üí° **Suggestions**: Code quality, best practices
4. ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Nitpicks**: Style, formatting (should be caught by linters)

## Review Comments Guidelines

### Writing Effective Comments

**Use Prefixes:**
- `‚ùó CRITICAL:` Must be fixed before merge
- `‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:` Should be fixed before merge
- `üí° SUGGESTION:` Consider this improvement
- `‚ùì QUESTION:` Needs clarification
- `‚ÑπÔ∏è NITPICK:` Minor style issue
- `‚úÖ APPROVED:` Looks good
- `üìù NOTE:` General observation

**Example Comments:**

```markdown
‚ùó CRITICAL: This endpoint is missing authentication. 
Please add auth middleware before merging.

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: This query could be slow with large datasets. 
Consider adding pagination or indexing the database.

üí° SUGGESTION: Consider using `useMemo` here to avoid 
recalculating this value on every render.

‚ùì QUESTION: Why did we choose this approach over [alternative]?
Is there a specific reason?

‚ÑπÔ∏è NITPICK: Consider using const instead of let here 
since the value never changes.

‚úÖ APPROVED: Great implementation! Clean and well-tested.

üìù NOTE: We might want to extract this into a utility 
function in the future for reusability.
```

### Being Constructive

**Good:**
```
üí° SUGGESTION: Consider extracting this validation logic into
a separate function for better reusability. Something like:

function validateUserInput(input) {
  // validation logic here
}

This would also make it easier to test.
```

**Bad:**
```
This is wrong. Fix it.
```

## Reviewer Self-Check

Before submitting your review, ask yourself:

- [ ] Are my comments clear and actionable?
- [ ] Am I being constructive and respectful?
- [ ] Have I explained the "why" behind my suggestions?
- [ ] Have I acknowledged good code and practices?
- [ ] Are my concerns legitimate or just personal preference?
- [ ] Would I be comfortable implementing my suggestions?

## Time Estimates

**Small PR (< 200 lines):** 15-30 minutes  
**Medium PR (200-500 lines):** 30-60 minutes  
**Large PR (> 500 lines):** 1-2 hours  

**Note:** If a PR takes longer than 2 hours to review, suggest breaking it into smaller PRs.
